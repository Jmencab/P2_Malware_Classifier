Don't change any of the filenames or imports are not goint to work.
(That includes writecsv.py)


writecsv.py should be run from the same folder as everything else - I just put
them in different folders so you know which file is which priority.


Also, please download the data and unzip it again just to be safe!


You do need keys.csv and util.py too, I forgot about them earlier - sorry!
